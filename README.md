# Acute Programming Language

Acute is a small language that concentrates on getting its core feature set
correct. Not a very opinionated language, it does aim to stick to its kernel.

The core features include:

* Strong dynamically typed
* Object-oriented with prototype inheritance
* Narrowly focused core
* User-defined data types
