Qish contains an opensource runtime library with a reusable
generational copying garbage collector for C or C++.  License is GNU
Lesser General Public License (see COPYING)


The lib/ subdirectory contains the runtime library.
The doc/ subdirectory contains the documentation (same as qishintro.html); 
you need LaTeX, ps2pdf, and hevea to regenerate it.

There is no more any ruko/ subdirectory in the distribution


Look on {http://www.starynkevitch.net/Basile/qishintro.html} for the
HTML version of the documentation (introduction to Qish). See also my
home page on {http://www.starynkevitch.net/Basile/} or Qish page
{http://freshmeat.net/projects/qish/} on Freshmeat for announcement of
newer versions (you can subscribe to announcements on Freshmeat).

To install the library, (edit the GNUMakefile or lib/Makefile if you
want to install under another PREFIX than /usr/local), then

	cd lib/ ;   make ;   su -c 'make install'

To use it, #include <qish.h> and follow the guidelines in
doc/qishintro.html (don't forget the BEGIN_*_FRAME() & EXIT_FRAME()
macros and the volatile qualifier).

If you happen to download and read this, please be nice to drop me an
email on this. Thanks.
